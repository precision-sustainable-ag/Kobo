note,note1,Field technicians--   Thank you for taking the time to complete this survey with each of your growers.  This important field history data will help us understand patterns across a variety of demographic and contextual variables. We could not do this work without you!   Please carefully read the following guidelines before you begin.        The first group of questions ask for general contact information and can be completed prior to sitting down with the grower.               Swipe left to advance to the next screen.,,false,,,,

note,note2,"You may save and exit the survey form at any point during completion. However, if there are required fields, it may ask you to fill those before saving. Saved forms will be stored on your device within the KoBoCollect App and can be edited at any time by clicking ""Edit Saved Forms"" in the main menu.  However, once a form has been uploaded (by selecting ""Send Finalized Form""  in the main menu), it can no longer be edited.",,false,,,,
note,note3,"You will be responsible for entering the data into the survey form, not the grower. This can be done over the phone or in-person, but you will need to schedule dedicated time to talk through these questions.     The survey has 20 general farm questions and 21 site specific questions and should take around 25 to 30 minutes to complete.",,false,,,,
note,note4,"If a grower has multiple trial fields, the survey will automatically prompt you to enter data for the additional fields; thus you only need to complete one survey per grower.  You will need to know the 3-letter trial code(s) associated with each trial field.",,false,,,,

note,note_to_farmer,"A Timeline to share with your grower: a technician will be in contact this spring. Cover Crop biomass is collected in the spring at the time it is terminated.  For our saftey it is nice to harvest biomass right before burndown. Please notify the technician when you think you will terminate, and we can harvest +/- 3 to 4 days around that time. We can also return following herbicide application, when safe to do so. We will return when the crop is planted.  When do you think that will be? How long after terminating the cover crop? It is important to record those dates. We will install moisture sensors in between the crop rows after it has emerged.  Please do all of your fertilizer applications, and other management operations the same as you always would in that field. Our equipment is designed to be sprayed over.  We will raise a solar panel after the crop has closed canopy. We will come take yield data by hand in a 10 foot section around the soil moisture sensors before you harvest with your combine. Please notify us when you will: terminate your cover crop, after crop planting, and before harvest.  Thank you.",,false,,,,
