For our safety it is nice to harvest biomass right before burndown. Please notify the technician when you think you will terminate, and we can harvest +/- 3 to 4 days around that time. We can also return following herbicide application, when safe to do so. We will return when the crop is planted.  When do you think that will be? How long after terminating the cover crop? It is important to record those dates. We will install moisture sensors in between the crop rows after it has emerged.  Please do all of your fertilizer applications, and other management operations the same as you always would in that field. Our equipment is designed to be sprayed over.  We will raise a solar panel after the crop has closed canopy. We will come take yield data by hand in a 10 foot section around the soil moisture sensors before you harvest with your combine. Please notify us when you will: terminate your cover crop, after crop planting, and before harvest.  Thank you.",,false,,,,
